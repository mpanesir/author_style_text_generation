# text_generation
Developing a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) using Keras in order to generate new text based on the authors style of writting.

The number of epochs can be changed to a higher number while using the code on GPU. As, my computer isn't that powerful, I limited the number of epochs to 3, but you can go upto 100 or even more.

I have used a Recurent Neural Network (LSTM) with the Sequential Model of Keras and Tensorflow.
